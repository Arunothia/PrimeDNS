# PrimeDNS: An Automated DNS Resiliency Provider
PrimeDNS is a DNS caching service that helps the user to continually maintain last known good DNS resolutions in the system's hostfile. It has been implemented in C# using dotnet core framework. 

# Getting Started
1. For running PrimeDNS locally:
	- Clone this repository to your local drive
	- If you donâ€™t have dotnet installed,  you can install it here - https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/thank-you/dotnet-runtime-2.1.0-windows-hosting-bundle-installer
	- Once installed, run the following commands
		```
		cd PrimeDNS\PrimeDNS
		dotnet publish --runtime win10-x86
		```
	- This will create a folder \PrimeDNS\PrimeDNS\bin\Debug\netcoreapp2.1\win10-x86 containing the executables needed to run PrimeDNS.

# Configure PrimeDNS to suite your purpose
1. AppSettings.json
	- The folder 'win10-x86' you created contains template AppSettings.json that you should edit to suit your needs.
	- Telemetry options are by default set to false
	- Currently, TTL Updater isn't fully functional, so keep that option as false.

2. Domains.json
	- The folder 'win10-x86' you created contains template Domains.json that you should use to add the domains of interest to you.

3. Data Folder Location
	- The default data (config files) folder is the folder containing PrimeDNS executables. 
	- But PrimeDNS provides you the facility to separate your data folder and we **highly recommend** that you create a separate data folder.
	- To do this copy the **Files**  folder from PrimeDNS\PrimeDNS and paste it into any location that suits you, let's call this location - <primednsdata>
	- Now, edit the AppSettings.json and Domains.json file in this newly created Files folder as suggested above.
	- Once this is done, you can run PrimeDNS by using the following command
		```
		primedns.exe <primednsdata>
		```
	- This will help your team to maintain your own personalized config files that won't get overwritten with every update to PrimeDNS.
